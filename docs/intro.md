# Welcome to the "IT Handbook"

## Who is this for?
This knowledgebase is aimed at anyone working in the IT space whether you are brand new or have been in this industry for years.

Even those of us who have been in the field for a long time can forget things.

## Purpose for creating this?
I (Chris), have worked in IT for over 10 years and during this time I have learned a lot and have always felt like sharing what I've learned.
I also have seen in various jobs where information has been gatekeeped for whatever reason and I have never been a fan of that.
Knowledge should be shared and that is exactly the goal with this "IT Handbook".
